I'm a DPhil student at Oxford (Christ Church) applying deep learning research breakthroughs to astrophysics. I developed a state-of-the-art active learning approach to classify 10 million galaxies with crowdsourcing and Bayesian convolutional neural networks. I also set a new benchmark at detecting merging galaxies.

Previously, I worked at Cytora using machine learning and messy open data to price insurance.
